    <h1>Thundercat</h1>
    <p>
        The man known as Thundercat was born as Stephen Bruner. This man is the genius behind the insane bass playing featured on his albums and in half of pop music today. Thats right, on top of being an established composer he's also a highly sought after studio musician. His helping hand can be heard from famous musicians like Kendrick Lamar and Flying Lotus.

    <ul><h3>Released Albums</h3>    
     <li>Untitled Unmastered: Is definitely my favorite release of his because of the sheer number of amazing songs crammed into it.</li>
     <li>The Beyond: This album houses one of my all-time favorite party anthems and I'll never forget it. </li>
     <li>The Apocalpyse: This was my first love, my introduction to his mastery and this baby will always have a place in my heart.</li>
