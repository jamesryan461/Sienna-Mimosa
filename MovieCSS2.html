    <h1>Akira</h1> 
    <p> 
    Nuclear fallout gripped Japan for many years following World War II. It changed their culture and altered their history in profound ways. This loss affected all and spurred creativity onward into greater and greater things as times passed. One of those things is the movie Akira. 
    This animated gem from Japan is set in a post-apocalyptic world gripped by nuclear fallout. The mysteries and great secrets of the nation are slowly leaking out to the world before history repeats itself. Plagued by famine, disease, and anarchic revolution, the nation is falling apart and the traces of which can be linked back to the first nuclear explosion.
